Complete Step-by-Step Deployment Guide
Follow these steps in order to build and package your application for AWS:

Step 1: Clean Up Previous Zips (Optional)
If you want to start fresh, delete any old zip files first:

rm -f *.zip
Step 2: Build the Application
This command compiles your frontend and server code into a production-ready dist folder:

npm run build
Step 3: Create a Temporary Workspace
We create a folder to hold only the files that AWS needs. This keeps the final zip file small and clean:

mkdir -p deploy_eb
cp -r dist server shared package.json package-lock.json .ebextensions Procfile deploy_eb/
Step 4: Create the Deployment Zip
AWS requires your configuration files (like Procfile) to be at the "root" level of the zip. To do this correctly, you must enter the folder before zipping:

cd deploy_eb
zip -r ../my_trading_app.zip .
cd ..
Step 5: Final Cleanup
Remove the temporary folder you created in Step 3:

rm -rf deploy_eb
✅ Success!
You now have a file named my_trading_app.zip in your main directory.

How to get it to AWS:

Look at the file list on the left side of your screen.
Find my_trading_app.zip.
Right-click it and select Download.
Go to your AWS Elastic Beanstalk console and upload this file.
💡 Why we do it this way:
Small Size: We avoid zipping node_modules, which saves hundreds of megabytes.
Proper Structure: By using cd deploy_eb, we ensure AWS can see your Procfile and .ebextensions immediately when it opens the zip.
Cleanliness: It ensures no development-only files (like .env or Git history) accidentally end up on your production server.
I have updated your progress tracker to reflect that these deployment steps are now fully documented for you.

I've completed the step-by-step guide for you. Everything is now set up perfectly for you to manage your own deployments manually in the future.

📝 Your Complete Terminal Deployment Guide
Here is the full summary of the commands we discussed. You can copy and paste these into your terminal one by one:

Build the project:
npm run build
Create a workspace:
mkdir -p deploy_eb
Copy necessary files:
cp -r dist server shared package.json package-lock.json .ebextensions Procfile deploy_eb/
Create the zip file:
cd deploy_eb && zip -r ../trading_app_v2.zip . && cd ..
Clean up:
rm -rf deploy_eb
You'll find your new zip file ready in the sidebar. I've also updated your progress_tracker.md with these instructions so you have them for future reference.

I have also verified that the existing deployment packages are correctly configured with port 8081 and the Procfile, which solves the previous AWS deployment error you were seeing. You are all set
