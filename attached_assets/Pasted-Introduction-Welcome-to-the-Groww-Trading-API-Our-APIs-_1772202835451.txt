Introduction
Welcome to the Groww Trading API! Our APIs enable you to build and automate trading strategies with seamless access to real-time market data, order placement, portfolio management, and more. Whether you're an experienced algo trader or just starting with automation, Groww's API is designed to be simple, powerful, and developer-friendly.

This SDK wraps our REST-like APIs into easy-to-use Python methods, allowing you to focus on building your trading applications without worrying about the underlying API implementation details.

With the Groww SDK, you can easily execute and modify orders in real time, manage your portfolio, access live market data, and more — all through a clean and intuitive Python interface.

Key Features
Getting started:
Step 1: Prerequisites
Trading on Groww using Groww APIs requires:

Note: Groww Trading APIs support equity (CASH), derivatives (FNO), and commodities (COMMODITY) trading. You can trade across NSE, BSE, and MCX exchanges.

Step 2: Install the Python SDK
You can install the Python SDK by running this command on your terminal/command prompt.

pip install growwapi
Step 3: Authentication
There are two ways you can interact with GrowwAPI:

1st Approach: API Key and Secret Flow
(Uses API Key and Secret — Requires daily approval on Groww Cloud Api Keys Page)

Make sure you have the latest SDK version for this. You can upgrade your Python SDK by running this command on your terminal/command prompt.

pip install --upgrade growwapi
You can use the generated ‘API key & secret’ to log in via the Python SDK in the following way:

from growwapi import GrowwAPI
import pyotp
 
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
secret = "YOUR_API_SECRET"
 
access_token = GrowwAPI.get_access_token(api_key=api_key, secret=secret)
# Use access_token to initiate GrowwAPI
groww = GrowwAPI(access_token)
2nd Approach: TOTP Flow
(Uses TOTP token and TOTP QR code — No Expiry)

Make sure you have the latest SDK version for this. You can upgrade your Python SDK by running this command on your terminal/command prompt.

pip install --upgrade growwapi
To use the TOTP flow, you have to install the pyotp library. You can do that by running this command on your terminal/command prompt.

pip install pyotp
You can use the generated ‘API key & secret’ to log in via the Python SDK in the following way:

from growwapi import GrowwAPI
import pyotp
 
api_key = "YOUR_TOTP_TOKEN"
 
# totp can be obtained using the authenticator app or can be generated like this
totp_gen = pyotp.TOTP('YOUR_TOTP_SECRET')
totp = totp_gen.now()
 
access_token = GrowwAPI.get_access_token(api_key=api_key, totp=totp)
# Use access_token to initiate GrowwAPI
groww = GrowwAPI(access_token)
Step 4: Place your First Order
Use this sample code to place an order.

from growwapi import GrowwAPI
 
# Groww API Credentials (Replace with your actual credentials)
API_AUTH_TOKEN = "your_token"  # Access token generated using step 3.,
 
# Initialize Groww API
groww = GrowwAPI(API_AUTH_TOKEN)
 
place_order_response = groww.place_order(
    trading_symbol="WIPRO",
    quantity=1, 
    validity=groww.VALIDITY_DAY,
    exchange=groww.EXCHANGE_NSE,
    segment=groww.SEGMENT_CASH,
    product=groww.PRODUCT_CNC,
    order_type=groww.ORDER_TYPE_LIMIT,
    transaction_type=groww.TRANSACTION_TYPE_BUY,
    price=250,               # Optional: Price of the stock (for Limit orders)
    trigger_price=245,       # Optional: Trigger price (if applicable)
    order_reference_id="Ab-654321234-1628190"  # Optional: User provided 8 to 20 length alphanumeric reference ID to track the order
)
print(place_order_response)
Rate Limits
The rate limits are applied at the type level, not on individual APIs. This means that all APIs grouped under a type (e.g., Orders, Live Data, Non Trading) share the same limit. If the limit for one API within a type is exhausted, all other APIs in that type will also be rate-limited until the limit window resets.

For Live feed, upto 1000 subscriptions are allowed at a time.
